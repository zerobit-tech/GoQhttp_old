                                            <p class="text-muted">
                                                QHttp has three way to manage TLS certificates:
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Embedded Certificate: QHttp is furnished with an internal self-signed certificate. While suitable for less critical environments, it is important to note that this embedded certificate is not recommended for deployment within a production setting.<br /> </li>
                                                <li>Let'sEncrypt Certificate Integration: QHttp offers seamless integration with Let'sEncrypt. Activation of this feature can be achieved by configuring the "USELETSENCRYPT" Environment variable. However, it's essential to acknowledge that enabling "USELETSENCRYPT" necessitates the availability of port 80 for Let'sEncrypt challenge passage.<br /> </li>

                                                <li>
                                                    Custom Certificate: For the utilization of your proprietary certificate, it is recommended to place the certificate files in the "./cert" directory. The file names must precisely match as follows: "qhttp.crt" for the certificate and "qhttp.key" for the corresponding private key. More details <a

                                                QHttp works on Windoes or Linux system. Recommanded configuration is Quad core processor with minimum 8GB RAM.
                                                The system needs IBM I Odbc drivers. Check <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/odbc-driver-ibm-i-access-client-solutions">this link</a> for more details on ODBC drivers

                                                In most cases, you dont need to open an port if QHttp is within your network.
                                                But if QHttp is installed on out of network (like on a cloud), you might need to open port 449, 8470 ,9470 8475 , 9475, 8476 and 9476.
                                                Please check with your network admin.
